    <h2>How To Make Beef Wellington Step By Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Place beef tenderloin in a small baking dish. Spread 2 tablespoons
            softened butter over beef.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
            Remove beef from the pan and reserve pan juices; allow beef to cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat.
            Sauté onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix together paté and remaining 2 tablespoons softened butter in a bowl; season with salt and pepper.
            Spread paté mixture over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll out puff pastry dough to about 1/4-inch thickness and place beef in the center.
            Fold up and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13-inch baking dish,
            cut a few slits in the top of dough, and brush with egg yolk.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)
            and continue baking until pastry is a rich, golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside to rest.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, place reserved pan juices in a small saucepan over high heat.
            Stir in beef broth and red wine; boil until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.
            Strain and serve with beef.
