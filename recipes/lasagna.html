        <h2>How To Make Lasagna Step By Step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic
                in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
                Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste,
                and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil,
                1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper.
                Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl,
                combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley,
                and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the
                bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
                lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta
                cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.
                Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with
                1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining
                mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking,
                either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil
                does not touch the cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
                Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
                Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
